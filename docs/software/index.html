I subscribe to the view that computer science researchers in the area of programming languages and software have two ways to disseminate their results.  Papers are the means of communicating ideas to other specialists in the area, and implementations are the means of communicating ideas to non-specialists, in the form of tools they can use.  My students and I probably devote more effort than is usual in translating our research into software that can be used by others.<p>
Here is a list of publicly available software systems with which I have been involved:
<UL>

<li> <a href="https://github.com/LuxGraph/Lux">Lux</a> is a system for high performance distributed graph processing.  Lux is built on top of <a href="http://legion.stanford.edu">Legion</a>.</li>

<li> <em><a href="http://stoke.stanford.edu">STOKE</a></em> is a program transformation/optimization system for X86 assembly based on
randomized search.

<li> <em><a href="http://legion.stanford.edu">Legion</a></em> is a programming model for heterogeneous and distributed parallel machines.

<li>  <em><a href="http://terralang.org">Terra</a></em> is a statically typed low-level language that is integrated with and meta-programmed by Lua (a dynamically typed high-level language).
Terra provides support for producing very high performance code using meta-programming techniques.<p>

<li>  <em><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~tdillig/mistral/index.html">Mistral</a></em> is a SMT solver incorporating support for abductive inference and fast solutions of integer linear constraints.<p>

<LI> <em><a href="http://sixgill.org">Sixgill</a></em> is a descendant of the Saturn project aimed at analysis of large C/C++ systems.  As might be expected, sixgill shares some features with Saturn, but also takes a new direction in being a <em>near verifier</em>, meaning that it is designed to be sound and in principle can be made into a full verifier if a few known soundness holes are plugged with more analysis and any bugs in sixgill are fixed.  Sixgill is also a complete rewrite and shares no code with Saturn.<p>

<LI> <em><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~isil/sail/index.html">SAIL</a></em> is an intermediate language designed for static analysis; it explicitly both a high- and a low-level representation, with mappings between them, to facilitate both analysis (on the low-level representation) and reporting (through the high-level representation).<p>

<LI> <em><a href="http://sequoia.stanford.edu">Sequoia</a></em> is a programming language for hierarchical memory machines.  A key feature of Sequoia is that data locality is expressible directly in the language.<p>

<LI> <em><A href="http://saturn.stanford.edu">Saturn</a></em> is a second-generation constraint-based analysis framework, primarily exploiting boolean satisfiability as the underlying constraint language.<p>

<LI> <em><A href="http://banshee.sourceforge.net">Banshee</a></em>,
which is a descendant of the
earlier <A HREF="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/Research/Aiken/bane.html">BANE</A>
project, is a framework for constructing efficient, scalable
constraint-based program analyses.  Banshee has been used in a variety
of projects outside our group, including by gcc.  UPDATE
2/2015: <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/software/banshee.tgz">Here</a>
is an updated version of Banshee that builds on a current (as of 2015)
32-bit Ubuntu VM.  Thank you Collin Gordon! <p>

<LI> <em><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/cbi/">Cooperative Bug Isolation (CBI)</a></em> is designed to leverage the power of thousands or millions of users to help isolate bugs in deployed software systems.<p>

<LI> <em><a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/cqual/">CQual</a></em> is a tool for adding type qualifiers to C programs to enable additional static checking.<p>

<LI> <em><A HREF="http://cs.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss">Moss</a></em> is a system for efficiently detecting copies or partial copies of documents within a large corpus.  Moss, which was first developed in 1994 and released in 1997, is widely used in engineering courses to help detect plagiarism in programming assignments.<p>

<LI> <em><a href="http://moss.cs.berkeley.edu/~moss/cap/index.html">CAP</a></em> is a
descendant of Moss that provides a query interface to millions of lines of open source software.<p>

<LI> <em><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/titanium/">Titanium</a></em> is a memory and type-safe explicitly parallel programming language based on Java.<p>

<LI> <em><a href="http://datasplash.cs.berkeley.edu/">Datasplash</a></em>, a tool for constructing database visualizations. <p>
<LI><A HREF="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/software/cooldist"> <em>Cool</em></a>, the <em>
Classroom Object Oriented Language </em>, is a small language designed
for use in an undergraduate compiler course project.  While small enough for a
one term project, Cool still has many of the features of modern programming
languages, including objects, inheritance, and strong static typing. <p>

Cool is built entirely on public domain tools; it generates code for a MIPS
simulator, <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/spim.html"> <em> spim </em></a>.  Thus, the project should port easily to
other platforms.  The project has been used for teaching compilers at many
institutions around the world and the source code is available.

The complete Cool distribution includes the manual, source and
makefiles for the compiler, source and makefiles for each of the
assignments, test cases for each of the assignments, and lecture
notes.  Because the project is still being used at Berkeley, only
the manual is available here.  If you are interested in obtaining the
complete distribution, send mail to <kbd>aaiken@stanford.edu</kbd>. <p>

<LI>
Illyria was finished in 1994 and is still on this page just for historical reasons.<p>

<A HREF="../software/Illyria.tar.gz"> <em> Illyria</em></a>
is a small functional language designed to illustrate a subtype
inference system based on solving systems of type inclusion
constraints.  Illyria includes the lambda calculus, polymorphic let,
constructors, case expressions, and record operations.  The type
language is rich, with union, intersection, complement, conditional,
recursive, and universally quantified types.  This package includes
the type inclusion constraint solver, type inference for Illyria, and
examples. <p>

Illyria runs under Common Lisp on Unix systems.  The only known problem
is  that Illyria does not compile under CMU Common Lisp, although it will
run interpreted in that environment. After retrieving
the package, do: <p>

<dt> % gunzip Illyria.tar.gz
<dt> % mv Illyria.tar dir/.
<dt> % cd dir
<dt> % tar -xvf Illyria.tar  <p>

See the instructions in the Illyria/README file. <p>
