<H3>Past Research Projects</H3>

All good things must come to and end, and to start something new we have
to stop something old, and so on and so forth.  Below is a list of
past research projects that I have worked but are no longer active, or at least
the activity is now irregular and unpredictable.

<UL>
<LI> <a href="https://github.com/LuxGraph/Lux">Lux</a> is a system for high performance distributed graph processing, is now available.  Lux is built on top of <a href="http://legion.stanford.edu">Legion</a>. </li>
<LI> <a href="http://stoke.stanford.edu">STOKE</a> is a stochastic optimizer and associated verification techniques for X86 binaries.</LI> 
<LI> DeduceIt is a system for checking student derivations in on-line courses; the idea is to provide a richer and more interactive electronic homework than multiple choice questions for problems that can be formulated as derivations in some formal system.  A number of things are available:
<UL>
<LI> A <a href="videos/DeduceIt.mp4">demo video</a> if you just want to get an idea of how it works.
<LI> The live <a href="http://deduceit.stanford.edu">DeduceIt system</a> (which is currently broken, sorry!), where you can try a number of different kinds of exercises developed for the undergraduate compiler course I teach.
<LI> Open source respositories for the <a href="https://github.com/Ejhfast/ProofFrontend">web front-end</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Ejhfast/Proof-Search">theorem prover back-end</a> if you want to hack on the system yourself.
</UL>
