<p>
<em> Cool </em> is a small language designed for use in an
undergraduate compiler course project.  While small enough for a one
term project, Cool still has many of the features of modern
programming languages, including objects, automatic memory management,
and strong static typing.
Cool is built entirely on public domain tools; it generates code for a
MIPS simulator, <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/spim.html">
<em> spim </em></a>.  Thus, the project should port easily to other
platforms.  The project has been used for teaching compilers at many
institutions and the software is stable. </p>

<p>
The complete Cool distribution includes the manual, source and
makefiles for the compiler, source and makefiles for each of the
assignments, and regression tests.  Instructors can obtain the
complete distribution by sending mail to <a href="mailto:aiken@cs.stanford.edu">aiken@cs.stanford.edu</a>.</p><p>
A student distribution of the project  is available.
 These distributions include object code for the
<em>coolc</em> reference compiler, assignments, and all documentation.
The only components omitted are source for the reference compiler and
the regression tests.</p>

<p>
A <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/publications/papers/sigplan96.ps">longer description</a> of the Cool compiler project is available, as are the <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/software/cool/cool-manual.pdf">manual</a> and (on request) lecture notes from a course that used Cool.
