- You are helping me with migrating the original page https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/index.html to a mkdocs-material clone, for a simpler to manage static page, enabling search and all the niceness that follows.
- Always prefer the mkdocs-material functionality over manual HTML methods, an overview, but not exhaustive list of Plugins:
  - Blog
  - Group
  - Info
  - Meta
  - Offline
  - Optimize
  - Privacy
  - Projects
  - Search
  - Social
  - Tags
  - Typeset
- general mkdocs-material functional reference:
  https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/ on topics like, but not limited to:
  Admonitions, Annotations, Buttons, Code blocks, Content tabs, Data tables, Diagrams, Footnotes,
  Formatting, Grids, Icons, Emojis, Images, Lists, Math, Tooltips
- The original html content in located in folder *aiken_raw/*, and the migrated mkdocs-material goes into the *docs/* folder
